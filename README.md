# Non-stationary heat transfer in a plate with anisotropy general view under the influence of impulse heat sources

In this paper presented the solution of a non-stationary two-dimensional heat equation in an anisotropic plate with given heat fluxes at the boundaries.

Scaling of the equation and boundary conditions, solution and subsequent scaling to the solution of the original problem is carried out.

The neural network is trained to instantly determine the temperature field for various thermal conductivity tensors, the components of which are characterized by the rotation of the coordinate axes by the angle $\varphi$.
